              A focused professional with experience in organizations affecting housing,
              immigration and urban issues as well as government and legal agencies within
              the finance and cyber security sectors.  This wide range of experience has
              expanded my academic focus on human rights and international politics.  I bring
              this broad organizational understanding along with project and organizational skills.
              Applies a highly organized and people-focused approach to elicit key objectives and
              requirements, and coordinate across multidisciplinary teams to achieve business goals
